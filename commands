1. Create a file named Dockerfile with the image content. In this case:
FROM python:3.6.1-alpine
RUN pip install flask
CMD ["python","app.py"]
COPY app.py /app.py

2. Run the following comand

docker image build -t python-hello-world [insert the file path here]

3. Check if it worked with the following command

docker image ls

Expected outpu:

REPOSITORY           TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
python-hello-world   latest              f1b2781b3111        26 seconds ago      99.3MB
python               3.6.1-alpine        c86415c03c37        8 days ago          88.7MB

4. Create a Docker Hub account (if you don't have already). Execute:

docker login

5. Tag the image with your username

docker tag python-hello-world [dockerhub username]/python-hello-world

6. Use docker push to push to docker hub

docker push [docker hub username]/python-hello-world
